# Project Verify Everything

This project aims to provide additional support for the Starknet ecosystem via
a series of ZK verifiers. The project scope is broad and may encompass creating
any number of verifiers.

The initial list of potential verifiers will be as follows:

1. halo2 (IPA)
2. halo2 (KZG)
3. Plonky2
4. Plonk

# This repo will be deprecated soon as our efforts are focused on optimizing the PLONK verifier. Please refer to https://github.com/NethermindEth/cairo-plonk-verifier for the latest details.
